# Commit Message Tips ✍️  
Good commit messages make your project history clear and easy to follow.  
They tell others what changed, why it changed, and help track progress over time.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Why They Matter  
- Help teammates understand your changes quickly  
- Make debugging easier by explaining the reason for changes  
- Keep your Git history organized and searchable  

------------------------------------------------------------

## Basic Format  
Type(Scope): Short Summary  

Examples:  
feat(ui): add dark mode toggle  
fix(auth): correct password validation bug  
docs(readme): update setup instructions  
refactor(code): simplify data parsing logic  

------------------------------------------------------------

## Writing Guidelines  
1. Use the present tense and imperative mood  
   Example: use “add login feature” not “added login feature”  
2. Keep the first line under 50 characters  
3. Add a blank line before the body if you include more details  
4. Explain *why* the change was made, not just *what* you did  
5. Be consistent with your format across commits  

------------------------------------------------------------

## Common Commit Types  
feat      a new feature  
fix       a bug fix  
docs      documentation changes  
style     code formatting or styling only  
refactor  code change that doesn’t fix or add features  
test      adding or improving tests  
chore     maintenance tasks like dependencies or configs  

------------------------------------------------------------

## Example of a Full Commit  
feat(login): add user authentication  

- created login form and password validation  
- added session support  
- updated navigation to show logout option  

------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Tips  
- Write meaningful messages — avoid “update” or “misc changes”  
- Commit often but logically (group related changes together)  
- Review your commit history to keep it clean and readable  

------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Takeaway  
A clear commit message saves time for everyone,  
helps track your work, and keeps your project professional.

🎃 Hacktoberfest started as a small idea by DigitalOcean in 2014 — they just wanted to encourage developers to make 4 pull requests in October to promote open source.

What they didn’t expect was that it would turn into a global movement with hundreds of thousands of developers from over 100 countries joining every year! 🌍💻
